Forward Collision Detection System
====================

This is the software behind an effort to create a low cost forward collision detection sensor add on for cars. 

Based on the ESP-32s, TFMini Lidar, and a cheapo mono audio amp + speaker.

TODO:
- Develop data processing algorithm for effectively estimating acceleration.
- Add dynamically generated tone output as warning indicators
